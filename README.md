# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning techniques.

## Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical features using One-Hot Encoding.
   - Normalize numerical features using StandardScaler.

2. **Modeling**:
   - A RandomForestClassifier is used for classification.
   - Model performance is evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Cross-validation.

3. **Results**:
   - The model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test set.
   - Precision, Recall, and F1-Score are also reported.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
